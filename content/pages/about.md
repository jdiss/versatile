## How I can help you

As a consultant and freelancer I can help you or your organization with:

* **Architecture** and **development** for web-based enterprise software,
* Consultancy for **agile** software development **practices and techniques**,
* Bespoke, manageable **websites** and software for **individuals** and **small businesses**.

## What I do

I combine creative problem solving and technical precision to great software. I specialize in: 

* HTML5, Javascript and CSS including frameworks such as React/Preact and Angular;
* Node.JS and Java on the server-side. 

I've also worked and gained familiarity with many different application servers, databases and development tools in my career. From ASP to PHP, Tomcat to Nginx or MongoDB to SQL Server.

Working with agile practices is also a big part of what I do. Both technically with principles of XP and in terms of people and process with Scrum.
