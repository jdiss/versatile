## About me

### How I can help you

As a consultant and freelance web architect and engineer, I can help you
or your organization with:

* **Architecture** and **development** for web-based enterprise software,
* Consultancy for **agile** software development **practices and techniques**,

### What I do

I combine creative problem solving and technical precision to make great
software. I specialize in:

* Client side development with *Javascript* and frameworks such as *React/Preact* and *Angular*.
* Server side development with *Node.JS*, *REST*, *GraphQL*, *Mongoose/MongoDB*.
* QA and continuous delivery for enterprise projects.

I've also worked and gained familiarity with many different application
servers, databases and development tools throughout my career.
From ASP to PHP, Tomcat to Nginx or MongoDB to SQL Server.

Working with agile practices is also a big part of what I do. Both
technically with principles of XP and in terms of people and process
with Scrum.

### More about me

I started working with the web in the late 90's. I went on to study
Internet Computing at The University of Hull, UK. After graduating,
I moved to London to work for [CMC Markets](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/)
developing web-based financial trading platforms. I then moved to
Amsterdam, working for [Backbase](http://www.backbase.com) in the online
banking sector. I am now working independently on my own with clients'
projects.

I live in Amsterdam with my wife, Lora, and son, Lennox. I practise Judo,
I run and like to paint when I can find the time!
